              Hello! <br /> My name is Adam Estefani
            </h1>
            <p>
              I was born and raised in SÃ£o Paulo-Brazil and now I call Toronto
              home. I'm an urban photographer who loves everything related with
              that, exploring the city on a sunny day or challenging umplesent
              weather conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I appreciate the challenges of creating an image, finding the
              right angle, the right lighting, experimenting new ideas and
              moving away from the comfort zone.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's really interesting to me that anything can change
              dramatically if you just look from another view point, and I'm
              grateful for the new perspectives that photography gives me every
              day.
